# TODO

Need to implement:

- UI for choosing angle & force for shot as well as the "shoot" button
- Every draw method should start with its own `setColor`
- Create a helper method for `setColor`
- Render all shot trails to one canvas, render ships, planets, and UI to another canvas. Update independently as needed
- better code to prevent planet-planet & planet-ship overlap
- randomize map again if total net force on ship is too high (pick some sensible cutoff)
